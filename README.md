## Refactor Tractor - What's Cookin'

## Description
For this project we were tasked with refactoring a previous students codebase while also implementing new features such as Network Requests, jQuery and SCSS. The learning goals had us focus on working with remote data, being able to work with and understand someone else's code, learning how to use the `fetch` API to pull and post information to a database.
